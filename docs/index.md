(It's good to have your strengths listed but the explanations aren't necessary in a resume.)
- __Optimization__ (Getting things done as efficiently as possible)
- __Adaptability__ (I am  able to do many different tasks in the same day)
- __Hard Worker__ (When it comes to work, I have always been a grinder. I always have tried to put my best effort into the work that I do. I have the mindset of good, better, best never let it rest until my good is better, and my better, best)
- __People person__ (My entire life I have had a very easy time getting along with everyone that I meet from any background)
- __Leadership__ (I am capable of being a leader, and have been in many leadership positions in the past. I love to lead by example and prove to others that my advice is worth their time)

- __Conflict resolution__ (I am really good at "putting out the fire". My entire life I have been able to avoid conflict and help others get calm as well)
